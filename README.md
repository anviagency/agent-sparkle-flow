# Agent Sparkle Flow

## Project Overview

Agent Sparkle Flow is a modular AI-driven development environment designed to streamline application building and automation. It provides a structured workflow where developers can focus on logic and features, while the system manages repetitive tasks, integrations, and environment setup.

## Core Features

### AI-Assisted Development
Helps generate, refactor, and document code with context-awareness through an intuitive chat interface.

### Automation-Ready Workflows  
Built-in support for integrating APIs, managing data pipelines, and orchestrating background tasks.

### Customizable Architecture
Uses a layered structure with clear separation of concerns (frontend, backend, data, automation).

### Scalability & Extensibility
Designed so developers can extend modules, add new APIs, or integrate third-party tools without breaking the core.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Routing**: React Router for single-page application navigation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to accelerate software delivery by combining best practices in frontend architecture and design, while maintaining flexibility for customization. It eliminates vendor lock-in and ensures that the project can evolve naturally with future requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or your preferred package manager)
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd agent-sparkle-flow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the application running.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build the application for development environment
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for all new code to ensure type safety
- Follow ESLint rules for consistent code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add proper error handling with try-catch blocks

### Component Development
- Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation for UI elements
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Create reusable components with clear props interfaces
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle

### State Management
- Use TanStack Query for server state management
- Use React's built-in hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend-First Approach
This project focuses on creating an exceptional user experience through React and modern frontend technologies, while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with various backend services.

### Component-Based Design
The architecture emphasizes reusable, composable components that can be easily extended and customized for different use cases.

### Type Safety
TypeScript is used throughout the project to catch errors early and improve developer experience with better IDE support and autocomplete.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist` folder** to your hosting service of choice (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
